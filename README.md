# Odin Basic Calculator
This repository contains the code for the [Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) assignment of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

At this point the odin project did not teach about CSS grid, so I tried to make it work as well as I can with just
flexbox.  
One limitation I ran into was pixel perfect alignment, the right side of the panel is a pixel off at some zoom levels.

I also was not entirely sure how to best approach users inputting invalid expressions.  
Should I assume what the user wanted to do and evaluate the expression how it would make sense? Or should I take them at face value?  
I chose the latter approach, though I don't know if it was the righ one.
